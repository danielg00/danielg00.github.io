On of the first docs I intend to upload is a PDF introducing (co)homology theory that eventually builds up and intuition better that "it counts the amount of n dimensional holes". The tentative table of contents can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/introtohomtheory.pdf). 

The abstract reads: 
	In this paper we introduce the reader to the theory of homology. In Part 1 we begin by covering the simple case of simplicial homology. We then seek generalisations and variants,
	and eventually formulate a more general notion of homology through category theory in Part 2. Finally, we use this more general notion to sample other forms of homology that arise in topics such as
	physics, algebraic geometry, and data science.
