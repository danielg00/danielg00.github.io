One of Wittgenstein's more notable proposals was that language doesn't play only a passive role in our conceptualis ation of the world, but also an active one. One can see this 
by examining the process of ideation. We:

1. Are given some form of sensory input and told that label/word etc X is given to this input,
2. We aggregate this over time to get a more general idea of what X is,
3. We then project that perception onto the world to find out what we can call "X". 


In linear algebra, or more generally tensor analysis, we have so called [*covariant* and *contravariant*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_transformation) co-ordinate transformations. In layman's terms: say we use some measure or scale
to measure a distance. A covariant transformation is one that directly distorts (shrinks or enlarges) the distance we are measuring. Conversely, a
contravariant transformation is one that distorts the measurement we are using, therefore giving the perception that the distance is changing.

Succinctly, one may think of *semantic* changes of a word as covariant transformations (same word, different concept) and *syntactic* changes as contravariant 
transformations (different word, same concept).

A concrete example of a covariant transformation are "stars". The underlying meaning of what we denote with the word ["star"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_astronomy#Early_history) has drastically changed over the course of time. Whatever the ancients thought stars were (gods, cracks in the sky to heaven, more Suns) they did not know stars were massive balls of predominantly hydrogen and helium, powered by nuclear fusion due to huge pressures at its core. 

Many of the politics discussed today are a result of this antagonism, and many falsely put syntax before semantics. I have no doubt that I've given a superficial treatment of the idea, but it is any interesting one nonetheless.
