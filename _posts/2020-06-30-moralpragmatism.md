### Positive statements Vs. Normative statements
One of the central problems of ethics is the ["is-ought" problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-ought_problem) formulated by Hume. To quote from wikipedia: 

*The apparent gap between "is" statements and "ought" statements, when combined with Hume's fork, renders "ought" statements of dubious validity. Hume's fork is the idea that all items of knowledge are based either on logic and definitions, or else on observation. If the isâ€“ought problem holds, then "ought" statements do not seem to be known in either of these two ways, and it would seem that there can be no moral knowledge.*

It seems evident by the fact that debates over morality and ethics are to be had, that human reasoning alone cannot stand to contruct a morally coherent world. In my moral framework, I introduce a 
a certain meta-ethical rule for normative statements, that roughly corresponds to moral pragmatism.

Assume one derives their "oughts" from empirical observations in the world and that the observer imperfectly summarises this data. Assume the "truth" is a probability distributions over all normative statements
the observer considers. One ought to chose the normative statement the minimizes the chance you are wrong (the mode of the distribution), but the intensity in which one demands or advocates for such changes
inversely depends on the variance of such distributions. 

Let's go over a very simple example.
