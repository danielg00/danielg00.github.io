### Mission Command Tactics

Mission Command Tactics (Mission-type Tactics, or the German Auftragstaktik) has it's origin in Prussian Army tactics, mainly developed around the time of the Franco-Prussian war c.1870. For a goal to 
be undertaken by subordinates, it emphasizes that it's the subordinates job to determine how the command ought to be fulfilled. On a large scale, this creates an army where squad, battalions, etc. operate
somewhat autonomously. This is what on structures (still to be fully adopted by NATO) that made Germany such an effective fighting for throughout the ages. Why does it work? As we will see later, it 
minimizes the chance that a failure will contribute to the debilitation of an army - for a distribution over possible outcomes, with the mean centered around the expected outcome, MCT reduces the variance
of such a distribution.

In a free market, we have an analogous system. From raw materials to a tertiary products, we have a hierarchy of independently operating capitalists, each motivated to maximise production (in most cases).
